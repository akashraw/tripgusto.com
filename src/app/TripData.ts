    //            `It all starts with an early morning departure from Rishikesh. With a spectacular 10 to 11 hrs drive along the majestic Ganges Valley to Joshimath which is situated at the altitude of 6100ft. Though high-speed networks are available all along the way I doubt you would be using any as the morning glimpses along the Ganges valley is breathtaking. Needless to worry we got you covered with tea and meal breaks for those grumbling tummies. For tea lovers, you are in luck, as this is Uttarakhand and tea is the only bonding beverage here. 

    //             Driving through national highway 58 you would come across one of the most wondrous places on the face of earth Devprayag.
    //             Here witness the confluence of the mysticism through the rivers Bhagirathi and Alaknanda transcending into Ganga. 
    //             This would be the first Prayag out of five (where two rivers meet each other) which you would be witnessing on this route.
    //             The route is mostly lively until you enter Srinagar where lies the foundation of one of the largest Universities in India. 
    //             This city also takes pride in one of the biggest dams ever constructed on the river Alaknanda. Next, we would be passing through the bustling streets of Rudraprayag. 
    //             The second Prayag out of the five where you will witness the convergence of river Mandakini and river Alaknanda. While leaving the city you will witness some breathtaking scenes. 
    //             Trust me this doesn’t stop here and by the way tea lovers, what good is a tea without the tanginess of pakoras and we have got you covered here as well to take a moment and sink in the flavor of tea, tangy pakoras, and nature.
    //             Next is Karnprayag the third Prayag out of five where you will witness the confluence of river Pindar and river Alaknanda. Pindar river is blue as the sky, it always leaves me in awe. 
    //             Next in line is the fourth Prayag, Nandprayag. 
    //             Here you will witness the convergence of the river Mandakini and river Alaknanda. 
    //             The town is relatively small but has its delicacies. 
    //             Through the hustling roads from Chamoli city, we will be crossing Helang. 
    //             This place has a vibe. Now we will be climbing over the clouds, this place is the elevator of the mountains. From this place, things will start bewildering your mind. 
    //             The northern wind calls for an adventure junkie. Soaring through these valleys we will take our first stop at Joshimath and then a short ride to Auli. 
    //             The 11 Km escapade. The key is to get checked in as early as possible. With scrumptious food waiting for you, the nights are gonna be spent around a bonfire.
    //             Before you dive into slumber open your windows and graze the starry night just to find the moon to be closer than ever and if lucky the starry sky.

    //             This day is full of surprises. After early morning breakfast, we’ll be taking the chair car to Auli top. The chilling weather and a scenic view with a hot cup of coffee is the perfect getaway. We’ll be embarking on an amazing escapade to Gurson Bugyal which is just 3 km ahead. After being back from this incursion we'll have a little rest and a musical night among the stars and then call the night.

The roaring of the Parvati river, the gust of Himalayan wind, and long trails between the alpine forests fill you with its sheer appreciation. The nights are mostly musical and around a bonfire.`,

The trek is mild and goes via the beautiful pinecone forests. It is said that Goddess Parvati once cooked kheer for her eldest son Kartikay. And since then the hot water spring sprouts till date.`,

        body:[//day 1 body
              `It all starts with an early morning departure from Rishikesh. With a spectacular 10 to 11 hrs drive along the majestic Ganges Valley to Joshimath which is situated at the altitude of 6100ft. Though high-speed networks are available all along the way I doubt you would be using any as the morning glimpses along the Ganges valley is breathtaking. Needless to worry we got you covered with tea and meal breaks for those grumbling tummies. For tea lovers, you are in luck, as this is Uttarakhand and tea is the only bonding beverage here. 
                Driving through national highway 58 you would come across one of the most wondrous places on the face of earth Devprayag. Here witness the confluence of the mysticism through the rivers Bhagirathi and Alaknanda transcending into Ganga. This would be the first Prayag out of five (where two rivers meet each other) which you would be witnessing on this route. The route is mostly lively until you enter Srinagar where lies the foundation of one of the largest Universities in India. This city also takes pride in one of the biggest dams ever constructed on the river Alaknanda. 
                Next, we would be passing through the bustling streets of Rudraprayag. The second Prayag out of the five where you will witness the convergence of river Mandakini and river Alaknanda. While leaving the city you will witness some breathtaking scenes. Trust me this doesn’t stop here and by the way tea lovers, what good is a tea without the tanginess of pakoras and we have got you covered here as well to take a moment and sink in the flavor of tea, tangy pakoras, and nature. 
                Next is Karnprayag the third Prayag out of five where you will witness the confluence of river Pindar and river Alaknanda. 
                Pindar river is blue as the sky, it always leaves me in awe. Next in line is the fourth Prayag, Nandprayag. Here you will witness the convergence of the river Mandakini and river Alaknanda. The town is relatively small but has its delicacies. Through the hustling roads from Chamoli city, we will be crossing Helang. This place has a vibe. 
                Now we will be climbing over the clouds, this place is the elevator of the mountains. From this place, things will start bewildering your mind. The northern wind calls for an adventure junkie.
                 Soaring through these valleys we will take our first stop at Joshimath to call in the night however those who are full of excitement at this point can witness the majestic Himalayas and the mysticism of the Joshimath temple. 
                Before you dive into slumber open your windows and graze the starry night just to find the moon to be closer than ever and if lucky the starry sky.`,
              //day 2 body
               `So, I am not an early riser but the thrill of this day won’t let you sleep for long. Mornings are lazy in the mountains and with a cold gust of air on your face, we will travel to Govindghat. Crossing the fifth Prayag that is Vishnuprayag, you will witness the junction of two soaring rivers here, Vishnuganga and Alaknanda. After a short while, we will be arriving at Govindghat. With a quick rest and online registration here, we will finally be reaching Pulna. Now here we will be ascending on a beautiful stone-paved path towards Ghangaria. The valley is full of waterfalls and rich vegetation. The stunning beauty is gonna leave a mark for a long long time in your hearts. This is just the start though. The trek route is well organized with local shops and lavatories, so those early morning haters like me rest assured you will find a moment to spare anyway. Foodies my brethren don’t worry I hear your bellies grumbling. We’ll be prepared with packed tiffins all full of surprises and joy. A picnic in the mountains sounds fun right. The whole valley goes along with the river Lakshman Ganga. Networks are scanty here but you should be able to connect with BSNL at Ghangaria. Finally, we will be reaching Ghangaria which is the ultimate stop at 9800 ft. This small village is freakishly lively concerning its size. We’ll be staying in a homely guest house with an appetizing menu for foodies like me. But tonight we’ll be resting here for tomorrow.`,
               //day 3 body
               `Early morning is the key here, we’ll trek to the valley of flowers at the altitude of 11500 ft. The valley is full of waterfalls and it's hard not to get used to it as it always fascinates me. Valley of flowers comes under Nanda Devi bio reserve so no littering guys. We’ll be having an amazing picnic in the valley. The flora and fauna are rich in this valley. The most astonishing is that the number of waterfalls just gets doubled. We’ll be scaling to the farthest edge of the Pindari glacier and guys here take a moment to breathe and let the time pass through you and try to find your solace in the clear skies and the greenest meadows. I know the whole idea is to be lost and then to be found again but the biosphere closes till 5:00 pm and we have to be back by then to Ghangaria. I doubt you would be able to take hold of your exhilaration as this place excites the soul itself.`,
               //day 4 body
               `Early morning we will start the trail and hike for (6 Kms) to visit at the “Hemkund Sahib”. It is a famous Sikh pilgrimage destination. In the afternoon we will trek downwards to reach Ghangaria and stay there for the night. The evening time is free and you can utilize this time to explore the stunning surroundings and for getting some rest.`,
               //day 5 body
               `This is the part which I hate the most, scaling down to the Govindghat via Pulna. Surprisingly the trek down is faster but doesn’t go out of the limb as these stone pathways are slippery due to constant moisture. Once back to Ghangaria, tea lovers are gonna have a pleasant time there. This will be a farewell to the most exquisite place on the face of the earth. We’ll be driving back to Rishikesh, rest assured overnight stay in a pleasant hotel in the epiphanies of the river Ganga would be already waiting for you guys. Have a time of a lifetime.`,
